# Bootstrap Theme Starting Point
This repository acts as a starting point for creating customised Bootstrap themes. 

## Grunt
Tasks are setup for Grunt to compile the values in `src` as follows:

### `grunt prod` (default)
Compiles the src for production to the `dist` folder.

### `grunt dev`
Compiles the `src` folder for development, with source map files, and unminified code.

### `grunt watch`
Watch the `src` folder for changes, and compiles when changes are detected.
